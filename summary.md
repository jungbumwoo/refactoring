### The First Step in Refactoring


Whenever I do refactoring, the first step is always the same. I need to build a solid set of tests for that section of code.
If you don't, you end up spending time hand checking some numbers from the test against some numbers of a desk pad, and that slows you down.

**Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.**

### Decomposing and Refactoring

1.
Tip. Refactoring changes the programs in small steps. If you make a mistake, it is easy to find the bug.

2.
Is renaming worth the effort?
Good code should communicate what it is doing clearly, and variable names are a key to clear code

Tip. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
