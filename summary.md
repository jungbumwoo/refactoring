### The First Step in Refactoring


Whenever I do refactoring, the first step is always the same. I need to build a solid set of tests for that section of code.
If you don't, you end up spending time hand checking some numbers from the test against some numbers of a desk pad, and that slows you down.

**Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.**
